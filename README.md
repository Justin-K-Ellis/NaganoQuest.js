# Nagano Quest JS

## About

This project is a choose-your-own-adventure type single page application implemented in React and Tailwind CSS. In this game, the user is taken on a tour of beautiful Nagano Prefecture, Japan, and can visit a number of locations and choose a number of routes to connect those locations. The game always ends with either a Good Ending or a Bad Ending.

This app is based on Python2 command line text adventure I wrote many years ago, but is now given a graphical treatment with the magic of JavaScript.
